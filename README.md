#### The purpose of this application is to provide a solution to help bridge the gap between laborers and industries in various sectors like construction, agriculture, public sectors directly by rooting out middle men. It is inspired by the difficulty faced by the migrant workers while travelling back to their hometowns during the CoVID-19 pandemic.
#### The app would provide details of laborers around the user, including their contact details. It will allow states to tap into their own labor resources first than look out for labor outside states minimizing logistical challenges and make it easier for people to register themselves (with valid verification) as laborers on the app, which will in turn help laborers to find work after the CoVID-19 crisis ends. Allows laborers to move within in different sectors of work based on their preference and skill set with ease. If adapted nationwide, it can ensure that workers donâ€™t have to migrate to other states looking for work, as they can find work in their respective areas itself.
